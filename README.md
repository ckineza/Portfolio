This repository contains different projects I have worked on. Any consulting projects that have done cannot be shared at the moment due to privacy rules. However, I plan to provide some insights on my Blog in the near future.
I hope this repository will be helpful, it covers concepts of: Poisson regression, survival analysis, logistic regression, spatial statistical analysis, 
Bayesian analysis, and a prediction algorithm for breast cancer risk (data scraped from Facebook Cancer Support Groups)
