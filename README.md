This repository contains different personal projects I have worked on. Both the analysis and write up of my findings. Any consulting projects that I have done cannot be shared at the moment due to privacy concerns. However, I plan to provide some insights on my Blog in the near future.
I hope this repository will be helpful, it covers concepts of: Poisson regression, survival analysis, logistic regression, spatial statistical analysis, 
Bayesian analysis, and a prediction algorithm for breast cancer risk( Gail score) using data scraped from different Facebook cancer support groups.
Please contact me for any questions or feedbacks.
