This repository contains different statistical analysis I have worked on. Both the analysis and write up of my findings. However, consulting projects that I am working on cannot be shared at the moment due to privacy concerns. But I plan on providing some insights on my Blog in the near future.
I hope this repository will be helpful, it covers concepts of: Poisson regression, survival analysis, logistic regression, spatial statistical analysis, 
Bayesian analysis, a prediction algorithm for breast cancer risk( Gail score) using data scraped from different Facebook cancer support groups, machine learning techniques: CART, Random Forest and Classification.
Please contact me for any questions or feedbacks.
